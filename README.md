## Compilation##
	- Your code will be compiled this way:
``$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c``
	- As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project.

# Tasks
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
- Write a function that produces output according to a format.

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
- Handle the following conversion specifiers:
	- d
	- i

2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
- Create a man page for your function
